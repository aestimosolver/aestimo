"""This module contains aestimo's global configuration settings for aestimo.py
and aestimo_eh.py. It contains parameters for controlling the algorithms that are 
used to calculate the bandstructures. 

The 'inputfilename' variable defines the default input file used when aestimo.py
or main.py is run directly as a script. There are also parameters that define the
defaults for saving and presenting results; as well as for logging messages.
